								<h3>Write From Your Happy Place</h3>
							</header>
							<p>Ever notice how when you’re stressed out and trying to “force” yourself to write something amazing, it almost never works?<br><br>

Research shows that getting yourself into a happy, relaxed state—think: taking a shower—is the key to creativity-on-command. When your body is experiencing a rush of dopamine, that’s when those a-ha! moments (“Ooh! I’ve got the perfect title for my presentation!”) tend to happen.<br><br>

Can’t take a shower at work? No worries. There are plenty of other ways to get into your happy place before you sit down to write. Play energizing music, <br>light a scented candle, bounce on an exercise ball—whatever it takes to help you unclench and relax!</p>

								<h3>Ask, “What Would My Hero Write?”</h3>
							</header>
							<p>If you’re struggling with a sensitive piece of writing where hitting the right emotional tone is essential, try channeling one of your personal heroes.<br><br>

“What would Mister Rogers write in this situation?” “What would the Dalai Lama say?” “How would Richard Branson handle this email chain?”<br><br>

Think: “In my opinion, the following approach is the best choice. If you agree, write back to say ‘yes,’ and I’ll get started.”<br><br>

Try taking a decisive stance, rather than wrapping up your writing with an open-ended prompt.</p>

							For example - Having J.K. Rowling be directly involved with the creation of this Fantastic Beasts film series seemed like a blessed gift, at the beginning.<br><br> Rowling's involvement brought an air of authenticity to the Harry Potter prequel saga, making it seem genuinely connected to the original series, and not just some attempt by Warner Bros. to keep cashing in. However, what was true during the Harry Potter film saga is still proving true now: J.K. Rowling's talent for imagination,<br><br> world-building, and characters is grossly oversized for the confines of a feature-film script.</p>

						<h2>And this is only a small step</h2>
						<p>It is all publically available information now and Aussies should use it now to become a writer.<br /></p>

						<p>
						We live in an era where the written word is King.

And if you’re going to write 40,000+ words this year—at minimum!—you might as well learn how to do your absolute best.<br />


						Do you enjoy writing? Does it come naturally to you? Do colleagues praise you for your crisp, articulate, Nobel Laureate-worthy email updates?<br><br>

						Regardless of where you find yourself, one thing is never absent from your side–some form of writing material, whether it’s paper and a pen, or a digital memo. Some people think it weird but, to you, it’s just the way you are. Ever since you learned the difference between the letters ‘A’ and ‘B’, you’d rather write it than say it.
